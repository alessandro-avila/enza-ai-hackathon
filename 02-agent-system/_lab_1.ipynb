    "## 1. Introduction to Semantic Kernel Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are agents in Semantic Kernel?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Semantic Kernel, an **agent** is a specialized component that can interact with Large Language Models (LLMs), process conversations, make decisions, and potentially execute code or call functions. Unlike simple prompt-based interactions, agents maintain state, follow instructions, and can engage in multi-turn conversations to accomplish tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "At their core, agents are designed to:\n",
    "- Process user inputs and generate contextual responses\n",
    "- Maintain conversation history and context\n",
    "- Execute functions when appropriate (function calling)\n",
    "- Work independently or collaborate with other agents\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Architecture in Semantic Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components in the agent architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Kernel**: The core orchestration engine that connects agents to AI services and functions\n",
    "2. **AI Service**: The underlying LLM that powers the agent (like Azure OpenAI, OpenAI)\n",
    "3. **Chat History**: Maintains the conversation context over multiple turns\n",
    "4. **Plugins/Functions**: Optional extensions that allow the agent to perform specific tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Agents in Semantic Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel primarily offers two types of agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ChatCompletionAgent**\n",
    "   - Lightweight agent that uses your kernel's chat completion service\n",
    "   - Good for simple conversational tasks\n",
    "   - Manages chat history locally\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **OpenAIAssistantAgent / AzureAssistantAgent**\n",
    "   - Uses OpenAI's Assistant API\n",
    "   - Maintains conversation state remotely as \"threads\"\n",
    "   - Supports advanced features like code interpretation and file searching\n",
    "   - Requires explicit thread management\n",
