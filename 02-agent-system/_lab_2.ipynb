    "1. **Specialization**: Each agent can focus on what it does best\n",

    "3. **Termination Strategy**: Decides when the conversation should end\n",
    "4. **Chat History**: The shared conversation context visible to all agents\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. User adds a message to the group chat\n",
    "2. Selection strategy chooses which agent responds next\n",
    "3. Selected agent processes the conversation history and generates a response\n",
    "4. Response is added to the chat history\n",
    "5. Termination strategy checks if conversation should end\n",

    "1. **Sequential (Round-Robin)**: Agents take turns in a fixed order\n",

    "   - Cons: Not responsive to content; might include irrelevant contributions\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Pros: Mirrors real workflows (e.g., write → edit → approve)\n",
    "   - Cons: Less flexible for unexpected situations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Selection**: An LLM decides which agent should respond next\n",
    "   - Pros: More responsive to conversation needs; adaptable\n",
    "   - Cons: Less predictable; requires careful prompt engineering\n",
