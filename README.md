# AI Hackathon for Enza

Build and run an agent system for the NextGB application. In this hackathon, we are going to explore the essentials of an agentic architecture that will allow us to perform queries against NextGB data in a conversational way, leveraging GenAI capabilities and autonomous solutions. Then, we are going to explore the basics of GenAI applications and Azure.

## Overview

The goal of this hackathon is to integrate GenAI capabilities with the NextGB application to create an intelligent agent system. This system will enable users to interact with NextGB data through natural language queries, enhancing user experience and data accessibility.

## Objectives

Understand Agentic Architecture: Learn the fundamentals of building an agentic architecture that supports conversational queries.
Leverage GenAI Capabilities: Utilize GenAI to process and respond to user queries in a conversational manner.
Integrate with Azure: Deploy and manage the agent system using Azure services.
